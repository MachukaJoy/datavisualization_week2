## Working with the IRIS dataset
1. Load the IRIS dataset (you can find it hereLinks to an external site.)
2. Select one pair of the numerical variables and plot them using a scatter plot. Make use of the `sns.lmplot()` to create the following lines:
- One for each group separately
- One overall regardless of groups
3. Create a scatterplot of the same (or different) pair of variables. Add a second legend which will show thew number of datapoints in each category.

## Creating insights from visualisations
Your objective is to use Seaborn to create a visualization that will help identify the top 3 factors that contribute the most to the success of a movie (measured by its IMDB rating). You will need to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset, manipulate and preprocess the data as necessary, and create a final visualization that clearly conveys your findings.

1. Load the "IMDB Top 1000 Movies" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. You can find the dataset (and some more information about it) hereLinks to an external site..
2. Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis.
3. Use Seaborn to create a set of exploratory visualizations that help you understand the structure and relationships in the data.
4. Identify the top 3 factors that are most strongly correlated with a movie's IMDB rating.
